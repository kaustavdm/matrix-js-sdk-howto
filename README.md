# Matrix JS client example

This repository contains a simple Matrix client written in JavaScript to run in the current Node.js LTS version. It uses the Matrix JS SDK to:

- login to Matrix as an existing user using `m.login.password`
- skeleton for adding the remaining code to join a room and send a message to that room

The `develop` branch contains a full example, where the bot waits till someone replies back "hello".
